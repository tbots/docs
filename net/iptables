 The Linux kernel's network subsystem called Netfilter, and iptables(1) is the command used to configure it. The iptables architecture groups network packet processing rules
 into tables by function, each of which have chains (sequences) of processing rules. Rules consists of matches, used to determine which packets rule will apply to,
 and targets (policies) that determine what will be done with the matching packet.

	Table		Function												Chain
	-----		--------												-----
	
	Filter		Packet filtering/firewall			INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT
	
	NAT				Network address translation		PREROUTING,INPUT,OUTPUT,POSTROUTING

	Mangle  	Packet modification						PREROUTING,INPUT,FORWARD,OUTPUT,POSTROUTING

	Security	Mandatory Access Control			INPUT,FORWARD,OUTPUT

	Raw				Bypass "conntrack" for				PREROUTING, OUTPUT
						corner cases
						

 iptables operate on the layer three of OSI model, ebtables designed as firewall for the layer two filtering.


 --append  -A chain			Append to chain
 --check   -C chain			Check for the existence of a rule
 --delete  -D chain			Delete matching rule from chain
 --delete  -D chain rulenum
 												Delete rule rulenum from the chain
 --flush   -F [chain]	 Delete all rules in chain or all chains
 --policy  -P chain policy
 												Change policy on chain to target
 --list -L [chain [rulenum]]		list the rules in the chain or all chains
 --list-rules -S [chain [rulenum]]
 											  Print the rules in a chain or all chains
 --match  -m match			Extended match (may load extension)
 --numeric, -n					Numeric output of addresses and ports
 --table  -t table			table to manipulate (default: 'filter')
 --delete-chain  -X [chain]
 												Delete a user-defined chain
 -jump -j target				target for rule (may load target extension)


 Examples:
  iptables --list --numeric --list [chain[rulenum]]
	iptables -P INPUT DROP
 	iptables --append CHAIN --in-interface <ifname> --jump ACCEPT
 	# lo - loopback interface
 	iptables-save > /etc/iptables.save
 	iptables-restore <filename>

 Tools:
 	firewalld (controls iptabes)
