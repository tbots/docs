 On Linux and Unix systems, information on how packets are to be forwarded is stored in a kernel structure called a routing table. The routing table can be used for both, static and dynamic routing.
 Dynamic routing consists of the kernel making decisions as to which route, out of multiple present routes, a packet should take.

 Commands:
 	
	netstat -r

 Add a route:

 	route add -net 192.168.122.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.122.1
