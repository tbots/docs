 The ISP must have an officially registered autonomous system number (ASN). A unique ASN is allocated to each autonomous system for use in BGP routing. AS numbers are
 important because the ASN uniquely identifies each network on the Internet.

 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the 
 internet.

 CIDR is the short for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, an IP addressing scheme that replaces the older system based on classes A, B, and C. A single IP address can be used to
 designate many unique IP addresses with CIDR. A CIDR IP address looks like a normal IP address except that is ends with a slash followed by a number, called the IP network
 prefix. CIDR addresses reduce the size of routing tables and make more IP addresses available within organizations.
