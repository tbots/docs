 After statement execution results can be retrieved at once to be buffered by the client or by the read row by row. Client-side result set buffering
 allows the server to free resources associated with the statement results as early as possible. It is recommended to use buffered results sets. 
 mysqli_query() combines statement execution and result set buffering. Navigation through the result sets is fast because it is held in client memory.
 It is often easier to scale by client than to scale by server.
 The character set must be set either at the server level, or with the API function mysqli_set_charset() for it to affect mysqli_real_ecape_string().
