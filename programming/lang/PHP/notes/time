To display a date, date() function is used. It expects a Unix timestamp value and an output format string. The definition is as follows:

  string date ( string $format [, int $timestamp = time() ] );

Timestamp is optional and default to the return value of time() that is a Unix timestamp for the current time.

DateTimeInterface is meant so that both DateTime and DateTimeImmutable can be type hinted for. It is not possible to implement this interface with userland
classes.

 Date and Time Functions

 	date_create - Alias of DateTime::__construct
	date_diff		- Alias of DateTime::diff()



	int strtotime ( string $time [, int $now = time() ] )
		
	 The function expects to be given a string containing an English date format and will try to parse that format into a Unix timestamp (the number of
	 seconds since January 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC), relative to the timestamp given in now, or the current time if now is not supported.

	 Each parameter of this function uses the default time zone unless a time zone is specified in that parameter. 

	 Parameters:

	 		time		A date/time string (see formats).

			now			The timestamp which is used as a base for the calculation of relative dates. 
							

	
	date_default_timezone_get()
