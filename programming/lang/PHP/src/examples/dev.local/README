 When website accessed first time init_db() function is called to initialize the database. Three initial tables will be created: users, acl and hosts.
 There is a csv directory that list all the data which is used to populate tables. For each host there is a csv with the list of the users and
 their respective acl numbers. hosts table is iterated and table is created for each server filling it using corresponding csv file. See db.php and
 db_connect.php files for the insights.

 Functionality includes: 
  + displaying acl per user per server
  + displaying list of users per acl per server
  + removing user from the acl of particular server
  + reseting user acl on the server
  + adding a user to server acl
  + displaying list servers where user has an acl set
