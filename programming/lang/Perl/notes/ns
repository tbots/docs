 Perl provides two kinds of namespaces: symbol tables and lexical scopes. You may have an arbitrary number of namespaces. Each defined name is stored in either or 
 another namespace type.

 Symbol tables are global hashes that happen to contain symbol table entries for global variables, including the hashes for other symbol tables). Lexical variables
 in contrast are attached to the scope of the code block and are visible only within this block. Lexically scoped variables are declared with a my, our, or state 
 declarations. 
 
 A symbol table in Perl is also known as a package, and variables it declares are called package variables. The variables are private to the package in which they exist,
 but they are global in the scence that packages themselves are global. Thus they can be accessed via package name. 

 If there is no lexical and package declarations found, Perl looks for the variable name in the unnamed top-level package, named `main`.


 [!]   The ' as well as :: are the valid namespace separators.
