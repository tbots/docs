 Daemon Process

 	A daemon process is a process which runs in background and has no controlling terminal. 
 Half-duplex UNIX Pipes

 Basic Concepts

	A pipe is a method of connecting the standard output of one process to the standard input of another. When a process creates a pipe, the
	kernel sets up two file descriptors. One descriptor is used to allow a path of input into the pipe (write), while the other is used 
	to obtain data from the pipe(read).

	Child process will inherit all the open file descriptors of the parent.

	All the data sent through the pipe traveling through the kernel.


 Process indetification.

  The pid_t data type is a signed integer type which is capable of representing a process ID. In the GNU C Library, this is an int.

  getpid() function and getppid() will return current and parent process IDs respectively.

 
 Creating a pipe.

  fd[0] - reading
	fd[1] - writing
