 PKI
 						separate certificate (public key) and a private key for the server and each client
						Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and key which used to sign each of the server and client certificates

 bidirectional (both directions) authentication is based on certificates. Client must authenticate the server certificate
 and the server must authenticate the client certificate before mutual trust is established

 both server and client will authenticate the other by first verifying that the presented certificate was signed by the master
 certificate authority (CA), and then by testing information in the now-authenticated certificate header, such as the certificate 
 common name or certificate type(client or server).

 Generate the master Certificate Authority(CA) certificate & key
