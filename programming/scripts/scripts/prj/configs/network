	
  BONDING_OPTS=<parameters>

	sets the configuration parameters for the bonding device, and
	is used in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond<N>. This 
	parameters are identical to those used for bonding devices in 
	/sys/class/net/<bonding device>/bonding, and the module parameters
	for the bonding driver.

	This configuration method is used so multiple bonding devices can have 
	different configurations. If BONDING_OPTS is used do not use
	/etc/modprobe.conf to specify options for the bonding device.

  BOOTPROTO=<protocol>
	
	Where <protocol> one of the following:

	• none - no boot-time protocol should be used
	• bootp - the BOOTP protocol should be used
	• dhcp  - the DHCP protocol should be used

   BROADCAST=<address>
	
	Where <address> is the broadcast address. The value is depreciated,
	as the value is calculated automatically with ifcalc.

  DEVICE=<name>

	Where <name> is the name of the physical device (except for dynamically-
	allocated PPP devices where it is the logical name).

  DHCP_HOSTNAME

	Use this option only if DHCP server requires the client to specify a 
	hostname before receiving an IP address.

  DNS{1,2}=<address>
	
	Where address is a name server address to be placed in /etc/resolv.conf
	if the PEERDNS directive is set to yes.

  ETHTOOL_OPTS=<options>

	Where <options> are any device specific options supported by ethtool.

	Instead of a custom init script, use ETHTOOL_OPTS to set interface speed and
	duplex settings.

  GATEWAY=<address>
	
	Where <address> is the IP address of the network router or gateway device (if any).

  HWADDR=<MAC-address>

	Where <MAC-address> is the hardware address of the Ethernet device in the from of
	AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF. This directive is useful for machines with multiple NIC's to
	ensure that the interfaces are assigned the correct device names regardless of the
	configured load order for each NICs module. This directive should not be used in
	conjuction with MACADDR.

  IPADDR=<address>

	Where <address> is the IP address.

  MACADDR=<MAC-address>

	Where <MAC-address> is the hardware address of the Ethernet device in the form
	of AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF. This directive is used to assign a MAC address to the 
	interface, overriding the one assigned to the physical NIC. This directive should
	not be used in conjuction with HWADDR.

  MASTER=<bond-interface>

	Where <bond-interface> is the channel bonding interface to which the Ethernet 
	interface is linked.

	This directive is used in conjuction with the SLAVE directive.

  NETMASK=<mask>
	
	Where <mask> is the netmask value.

  NETWORK=<address>

	Where <address> is the network address. This directive is deprecated, as the
	value is calculated automatically with ifcalc.

  ONBOOT=<answer>

	Where <answer> is one of the following:
	
	  • yes  - this device should be activated at boot-time.
	  • no   - this device should not be activated at boot-time.

  PEERDNS=<answer>

	Where <answer> is one of the following:
	
	  • yes  - Modify /etc/resolv.conf if the DNS directive is set. When using 
		   DHCP, then yes is the default.

	  • no   - Do not modify /etc/resolv.conf.

  SLAVE=<bond-interface>

	Where <bond-interface> is one of the following:

	  • yes  - This device is controlled by the channel bonding interface specified 
                   in the MASTER directive.
                   
	  • no  -  This device is not controlled by the channel bonding interface specified 
                   in the MASTER directive. 
	  
	This directive is used in conjuction with the MASTER directive.

  SRCADDR=<address>

	Where <address> is the specified source IP address for outgoing packets.

  USERCTL=<answer>

	Where <answer> is one of the following:
	
	  • yes  - Non-root users are allowed to control this device.

	  • no   - Non-root users are not allowed to control this device.
