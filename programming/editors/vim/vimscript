  Loops
 	
	 :while {condition} 
    :{statement} 
   :endw[hile]

	Example:
   Yank text to any register and then execute it from the command prompt with "@" command.
   let i=1
   while i < 10
	   echo "i " i
	 	 let i += 1
   endw


	"for" loop

	 Generic form:
	   for {var} in {list}
	   endfo{r}

		Note, the ':' is optional

	   for i in range(0,9)
	    ech "i " i
	   endfor


	Example:
   Yank text to any register and then execute it from the command prompt with "@" command.
   let i=1
   while i < 10
	   echo "i " i
	 	 let i += 1
   endw

    
	 Numbers

	Vim understands four types of numbers: binary, octal, decimaland hexadecimal. Depending on the prefix,
	the numbers interpreted differently. Use '0x' for the hexadecimal and '0' for the octal, and '0b' for
	the binary number system.
		
	To see a list of the currently defined variables, just run "let" without arguments.
		

		

  Arithmetics.

   :let {variable} = {expression} 

    Set internal variable to the result of the expression. The variable will get the type
    from the expression. Value of the variable does not reset between evaluations in the
    same file(buffer).


  Echoing commands.

   :ec[ho] {expr1}...

    Echoes each expression, with a space in between. The first expression starts on a new line.
    If there is a new line in a form:
      :echo "word1" "\n" "word2"
    
    word2 is written on the new line with the space before, to avoid it write:
      :echo "word1" "\nword2"
    or
      :echo "word1\nword2"
      
    See `:h :echoh!` for output highlighting. 

    Examples:
      :echo "the value of the 'shell' is " &shell

	:for {var} in {list}
	:if
	:finish
	:echo [&command]
	:echoh
	:range
	:messages
	:&command " will not work out of echo

 	
	Comments (") are allowed 
	++ operator will not work
 :echo expand('$variable')
 :echo $variable

 "	 Source a global configuration file if available
 if filereadable("/etc/vim/vimrc.local")
  source /etc/vim/vimrc.local
endif

Redirection to a register (wow! redir)
