 ENTRYPOINT usage examples.

 Build an images with:
  $ docker build --tag shell_access -f Dockerfile1 .
  $ docker build --tag binary_access -f Dockerfile2 .

 When specified in the shell form (Dockerfile1), '/bin/sh -c' is called underline, that is opposite from exec form where executable
 is called directly.

 Run containers with:
  $ docker run --rm shell_access
  $ docker run --rm binary_access

 [!] Note, when exectuable is called directly variable interpolation is not happening.
