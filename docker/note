 Docker is a command-line client, a background daemon and a set of remote services. It utilizes Linux technology called containers, or Unix "jail" concept. Unlike virtual machines, Docker
 containers don't use hardware virtualisation. Programs running inside Docker contrainers interface directly with the host's Linux kernel. Because there is no additional layer between the
 program running inside the container and the operating system, no resources are wasted by running redundant software or simulating virtual hardware - Docker is not a virtualisation technology,
 instead, it assists in utilising the container technology already built in operating system.

 Images are defined by a Dockerfile. Dockerfile defines an environment inside a container.
