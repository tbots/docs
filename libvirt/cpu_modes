 CPU modes (processor modes, CPU states, CPU privelege levels) are operating modes for the central processing unit of some computer architectures that place
 restrictions on the type and scope of operations that can be performed by certain processes being run by the CPU. The design allows the operating system to
 run with more priveleges than application software.

 Ideally, only highly trusted kernel code is allowed to execute in the unrestricted mode. Everything else, including non-supervisory portions of the operating
 system, runs in a restricted mode and must use a system call to request the kernel to perform on its behalf any operation that could damage or compromise the 
 system, making it impossible for untrusted programs to alter or damage other programs or the computing system itself.

 In practice, however, system calls take time and can hurt the perfomance of a comuting system, so it is not uncommon for system designers to allow some time-
 critical software (especially device drivers) to run with full kernel privileges.

 Multiple modes can implemented allowing a hypervisor to run multiple operating system supervisors beneath it, which is the basic design of many virtual machine
 systems available today.
