 depl/run.sh			issue an installation script on the remote machine
 ~~~~~~~~~~~			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 									
		For any successfull invocation <file>.dep has to be specified (-c file.dep), as it lists all necessarily variables used by script.

		PRJ																		# project name
		DEP_HOST=192.168.133.84								# target host
		PRJ_PTH=~/lotylda/depl/nginx					# absolute path to the deployment directory
		SCRIPT=nginx.sh												# name of the deployment script
		VARS=vars															# vars file
		
		Also any of the following shortcuts found on the command line will alter corresponding dep file.

			NGINX			-	nginx.dep
			NAGIOS		- nagios.dep
			DPC				- dpc.dep

		vars file ($VARS) references all the variable actually used by the deployment script, it will be passed as a command line argument
		and will be `sourced' as a script starts

		NOTE:			if one of the file.dep or vars is missing deployment operation will FALL!

		Options:
			-h host							specify a target host

			-p proxy						specify proxy server address

			-l [VAR,...]				will print all the variables defined in both config files (file.dep and vars) or just those specified on the 
													command line

			-s VAR=VAL,...|-i		set VAR to VAL, proper config file will be found automatically
													in case of  -i  was specified along to  -s  will issue interactive prompt for the 
													each variable, you can type `ENTER' to keep the defaults or `q' to stop interactive mode
												

		Either  -s  or  -l  will cause script to terminate without starting installation procedure.


		If found VAR=VAL,... but without any  -s  or  -l, pairs will be passed to the deployment script and used ONLY for current session.


		Examples:

				./run.sh -c nginx.dep -s UID_NGINX=nginx
												
												will reset UID_NGINX to `nginx' within config file

	
				./run.sh NGINX -l
												
												list all the variables used


				./run.sh NGINX
											
												issue deployment script on the remote host
				

				./run.sh -c nginx.sh -h 192.168.133.85
									
												issue deployment and specify target host address for the current session
												DEP_HOST within .dep file defines target host


				./run.sh -c nginx.sh -p IWEBBENCZ-1.tgn.trw.com:80

												issue deployment script and specify proxy server address for the current session
												PROXY within vars file defines permanent proxy address

		NOTEs:

				if UID_EMP and GID_EMP values not set in VARS, user will be prompted for them and offered to set it
				to the current values specified in EMP_INI

				on the remote side this values will overwrite any values set in EMP_INI
