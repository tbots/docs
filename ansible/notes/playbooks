	[Hosts and Users]
		
	For each play in a playbook, you get to choose which machines in your infrastructure to target and what remote user to complete the steps (tasks) as.

	The generic form of playbook is as follows:

		hosts:		  			a list of one or more groups or host patterns, separated by colons
		remote_user:			<name of the user account
		order:						inventory|reverse_inventory|
		gather_facts: <bool>
    vars:
      <list>:
        <item>: <value>
        ...

       <list>:
         - {{ list }}

		tasks:
			- <task>:
				<variable>: <value>


	Ansible by default assumes that SSH keys are used for authentication. Private key will be searched under home directory of the user that invoked ansible-playbook. Set
  `ansible_ssh_private_key_file' value under vars section or pass `--private-key' option on the command line to specify an alternate key file path. User used for remote
  connection is set with `--user(-u)' option or by specifying a value to `remote_user' or `ansible_ssh_user' directive. To authenticate user with the password pass `--ask-pass(-k)'
  option on the command line. After logged into machine you can switch execution under another priveleged user account specified by `--become-user' with `--become' option 
  and force password prompt with `--ask-become-pass'.  Password to the sudo can be passed with the `ansible_become_pass' variable in plain text or using vault.

   - name: Installing apache2 and php
     hosts: abs
     remote_user: osergiyuk
     become_user: ansible
     become: yes
     vars:
       ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/osergiyuk/.ssh/id_rsa
       ansible_become_pass: child_In_Time3
       packages:
         - apache2

   $ ansible -i /home/osergiyuk/docs/ansible/hosts weekend --module-name ping --user osergiyuk --private-key /home/osergiyuk/.ssh/id_rsa

 	ansible(1) program is used to run a single task on the host(s). The usage is:

    ansible <host-pattern> [options]...

	Host can be a group name, individual host listed in inventory file or on the command line, or one of the `all' or `localhost' keywords.  Inventory file is specified 
  with `--inventory(-i)' (former --inventory-file) option as a single file or a comma-separated list.  Specify module name with `--module-name(-m)' and it's args with `--args(-a)' options.


   $ ansible all --user root \
	               --ask-pass \
	               --inventory localhost, hosts_file \
	               --module debug \
	               --args "msg={{ 'password' | password_hash('sha512', 'salt') }}"


  To see the list of the matching hosts run:
   $ ansible -i <inventory-file> --list-hosts <pattern> 
   
  or 
   $ ansible-playbook --list-hosts users.yml

  to see hosts specified in the playbook. Optionally use `--limit(-l)' for the host pattern to apply on entire inventory.
	 $ ansible east --list-hosts --limit='10.*' 

  To set additional variables as a key/value pair use `--extra(-e)' option.
   $ ansible localhost -m ping -e 'ansyble-python-interpreter=/usr/bin/python'

  Use --args(-a) to specify a module argument.
