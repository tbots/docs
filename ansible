	 ./defaults -> main.yml				
	 ./files ->
	 ./templates
	 ./handlers
	 ./meta
	 ./tasks -> main.yml
	 ./vars
	
	The 'defaults' directory lists variable defaults that take lower precedence; if a variable is defined nowhere else, the
	definition given in defaults/main.yml will be used.

	The 'files' and 'templates' directories contain affiliated files and templates that are used within the role.

	The 'handlers' directory is used to store tasks that may be flagged during a play to run at the play's completition. 

	The 'meta' directory contains authorship information which is useful to publish a role on galaxy.ansible.com. It may 
	also be used to define role dependencies. Role dependency allows to require that other roles be installed prior to the 
	role in question.

	The 'tasks' directory is where most of your role will be written. This directory includes all the tasks that role will run. 
	Ideally, each logically related series of tasks would be laid out in their own files, and simply included through the main.yml
	file in the tasks directory.

	The 'vars' directory is where necessary valiables for your roles are defined. They are ment for internal use only.
