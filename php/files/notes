		Modes:
			
			r			open for reading only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file
			r+		open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file
			w			open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to
						zero length. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it
			w+		open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to
						zero length. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it
			a			Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this mode,
						fseek() has no effect, writes are always appended.
			a+		Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. 
			x			Create and open file for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file. If the file already exists, the fopen()
						call will fail by returning and generating an error of level E_WARNING. 
			x+		Create and open for reading and writing; otherwise has the same behavious as with 'x'.
			c			Open the file for writing only; If the file does not exist, it is created. If it exists, it is neither truncated, nor the call to this function
						fails. The file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file. 
			c+		Open the file for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same behavior as 'c'.
			e			Set close-on-exec flag on the opened file descriptor.
