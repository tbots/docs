 int count ( mixed $array_or_countable [, int $mode = COUNT_NORMAL] )

 array str_split( string $string [, int $split_length = 1] )	- converts a string into array

 array preg_split( string $pattern, string $subject [, int $limit = -1 [, int $flags = 0 ]] )
 								split the given string by a regular expression

								limit  if specified, the only substring up to limit are returned with the rest of the string being placed in the
								last substring. A limit of -1 or 0 means "no limit" and, as is standard across PHP, NULL can be used to skip to the
								flags  parameter.

 array explode( string $delimiter, string $string [, int $limit = PHP_INT_MAX ] )

 								returnes an array of strings, each of which is a substring of string formed by splitting it on boundaries formed by the string
								delimiter
