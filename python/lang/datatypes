 There are four buil-in data structures: list, tuple, dictionary and set. They can be organized into four different families:

 	+ Ordered data structure (tuple, list)
	+ Unordered data structure (dictionary, set)
	+ Mutable (set, list, dictionary)
	+ Unmutable (tuple)

 A mutable data structure can change its size, whereas an immutable data structure will always maintain the same size.

 A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items. Lists indicated by square brackets, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. 

 Tuples may achieve a performance utilization due to immutability. They should be seen as a dictionary where items are organized logically and not as key pair value.

 A dictionary is a key-value data structure. Value is refered by the index name. Key of the dictionary can be only created by using an immutable object, and the value
 can be neither mutable or immutable.

 Sets are unordered collection of unique simple elements.
