 Making an object from a class is called instatiation, and the object itself called instance.

 A function that is a part of a class is called method.

 The init() method.

 The init() is a special method that is called each time whenever we create an instance based on the class. Leading and trailing underscores are denoting 
 default methods from the custom ones.

 self parameter is required in the method definition, and it must come before the other parameters. Every method call associated with the class automatically passes
 self, which is reference to the instance itself. It gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. 

 Every attribute in a class needs initial value.
