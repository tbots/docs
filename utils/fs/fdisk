 fdisk is a dialog-driven program for creation and manipulation of partition tables. Block devices can be divided into one or more logical disks called 
 partitions. This division is recorded in the partition table, usually found in sector 0 of the disk. It understands GPT, MBR, Sun, SGI and BSD partition tables.  
 All partitioning is driven by device I/O limits by default. fdisk(8) is able to optimize the disk layout for the 4K-sector size and use an alignment 
 offset on modern devices for MBR and GPT.
