 
 In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed by a single server. The server and each client are separate processes 
 which communicate through a socket in /tmp.  

 #{pane_current_path} track current pane path location

 To create a new session:

  tmux new-session -s docker  			# create new session names docker
  tmux new-session -d -s ansible    # create session in detached mode
  tmux new-session -A -s ex       # attach or create session ex; no error if session already exists
  tmux att -d -t <session>  # attach to a session and detatch all the other clients

	
 To create a new window:

  tmux new-window -t <session:window> -a -n ssh   

  # or neww, insert new window at the next index from the target-window,
  # moving up windows if necessary; DO NOT use index, use window name instead to
  # specify a target window

 Creating a new window.

 Moving windows.
  
	To move windows use move-window (alias: movew) command. The syntax is:
		move-window [-ardk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]

	If it is a gap >1 between numbers in the two tmux windows, run `move-window -r' to get them resorted in the proper order and closing the gap.
		
 Splitting windows:

	 split-window [-bdhvP] [-c start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane] [shell-command] [-F format]
      (alias: splitw)

   Create a new pane by splitting target-pane. -h is for horizontal split and -v a vertical split; if neither specified, -v is assumed.
