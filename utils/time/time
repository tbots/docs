 timedatectl list-timezone|set-timezone|status  // will display system clock.

 Unix system has two clocks. A hardware clock/real time clock (RTC) and a system clock.

 The hardware clock is physically present and continues to run from battery power if the system is not plugged into power source. When system boots it will read time from the hardware 
 clock, this initial time is then passed to the system clock.

 The system clock runs in the kernel and synchronize with an NTP server to become up to date.
