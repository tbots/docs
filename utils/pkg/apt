 Configuration.

  apt.conf is the main configuration file for the APT suite of tools, all tools make use of the configuration file and a common
	command-line parser to provide a uniform environment. When an APT tool starts up it will read the configuration specified by
	the APT_CONFIG environment variable (if any) and then read the files in Dir::Etc::Parts, then read the main configuration file
	specified by Dir::Etc::main then finally apply the command-line options to override the configuration directives, possibly 
	loading even more config files. 

	The configuration file is organized in a tree with options organized into functional groups. Option specification is given with a
	double colon notation, starting from a tool group, tool name, and an option name. Options do not inherit from their parent groups.

	Syntacticly, the configuration language is modeled after what the ISC tools use. Lines starting with `//` are treated as comments
	and ignored till the end of a line. Each line is of the form:

	APT::Get::Assume-Yes "true";		// trailing semicolon is required and the quotes are optional

	APT { Get { Assume-Yes "true"; Fix-Broken "true"; }; };		// scoping several options; newlines are allowed for readibility

	RPM::Allow-Dublicated { "kerner";								// passing a list
												  "kernel-smp";
												};

 Check /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/{apt.conf,configure-index.gz}. 

 Two specials are allowed, `#include` and `#clear`, the first will include the given file, unless the filename ends in a slash,
 in which case the whole directory is included, the second is used to erase a list of names.

 All of the APT tools take a -o option which allows an arbitrary configuration directive to specified on the command line. The 
 syntax is a full name of the configuration item (see man page of the specific tool for a details), followed by an equal sign, then
 the new value of the option. Lists can be appended too, by adding a trailing :: to the list name. Probably `-o RPM::Allow-Duplicated=..` dunno..

 [!] Command line options should be specified before a package name.
 [!] If package requires (depends) installation of another package then the prompt is issued.
