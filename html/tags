 an element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equal sign. HTML markup can be divided into two types: structural - the elements that

 How browser process a web page?
  
	After browser receives a html page it creates a model of the page and stores it in memory. Beneath a document object each element seen as  a new node that is another object.
	If there is no CSS, the rendering engine will apply default styles to html elements. When the browser receives CSS rules the rendering engine processes them and applies each
	rule to it's corresponding elements. Javascript code is processed using an interpreter or scripting engine. 

	Web page can be divided into a three layers: content, presentation, and a behavior. These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called 
	progressive enhancment.
