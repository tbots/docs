 From the user's point of view, a database is a collection of one or more tables (and nothing but tables). 
 A table: 
 					 * Is the database structure that holds data
					 * Contains data about a specific entity type. An entity type is a class of distinguishable real-world objects, events or concepts
					 	 with common properties.
					 * It is two-dimensional grid characterzed by rows and columns
					 * Holds a data item called a value at each row-column intesection
					 * Has at least one column and zero or more rows. A table with no rows is an empty table.
					 * Has a unique name within a database/schema.

 A DBMS (Database Management System) uses two types of tables: user tables and system tables. User tables store user-defined data. System tables
 contain metadata - data about database - such as structural information, physical details, performance statistics, and security settings. System
 tables collectively are called the system catalog; the DBMS creates and manages this tables silently and continually. This scheme conforms with the
 relational model's rule that all data be stored in tables.

 Tables have the attractive property of closure, which ensures that any operation performed on a table yields another table. Closure guarantees that 
 you'll get another table as a result no matter how you split or merge tables. This property lets you chain any number of table operations or nest them
 to any depth. Unary (or monadic) table operations operate on one table ro produce result table. Binary (or dyadic) table operations operate on two tables 
 to produce a result table.
