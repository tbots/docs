 The file systems and their mount points in the directory tree during startup are configured in the file /etc/fstab. This file contains 1 line with 6 fields for each mounted file system. Their
 respective meanings are:
 		 · (Field 1)   Name of the device file, or the file system label, or the UUID (Universaly Unique Indentifier). Use of LABEL=<label> or UUID=uuid has the advantage that the 
		 							 partition is mounted correctly even if the device file used changes (i.e., when you swapped hard disks on the IDE controller)

		 · (Field 2)	 Mount point - the directory to which the file system should be mounted. The directory specified here must already exist. You can access the content of the media 
		 							 by changing to the respective directory.
		
		 · (Field 3)	 File system type (i.e., ext2 or ext4)

		 · (Field 4)	 Mount options, options are comma-separated list
		 · (Field 5)	 Indicates whether to use the backup utility dump(1), 0 means no backup
		 · (Field 6)	 Indicates the sequence of the file system checks (with fsck utility) when the system is booted:
		 									0   file systems are not to be checked
											1		the root directory
											2   all other modifiable file systems; file systems on different drives are checked in parallel

 The /etc/mtab file lists the file systems currenlty mounted and their mount points. The mount and umount commands affect the state of mounted file systems and modify the /etc/mtab file.
 
 The Kernel also keeps information for /proc/mounts, which lists all currenlty mounted partitions. The /proc/mounts data is always more current and reliable than /etc/mtab.
