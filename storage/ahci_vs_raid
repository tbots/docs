 AHCI (Advanced Host Controller Interface)  is standard for the storage interface that lets software, typically on OS to communicatice with the SATA devices. AHCI enabled some
 of the capabilities inherent in SATA devices to actually be used on the OS side, i.e. hot swapping devices. Native Command Queuing (NCQ) on hard drives is a prominent feature
 introduced in SATA on the hardware side and AHCI on the OS side. Rather that operating on a traditional serial command queuing, first-in, first-out command execution process,
 NCQ lets disks including SSD's to optimize how they handle simultaneous storage operations. The benefits are different, depending on the type of storage in use. 

 The NVMe (Nonvolatile Memory Express) standard has been developed to replace older interfaces, such as SATA, and introduce new command management capabilities. VNMe is designed
 for flash, eliminating the downsides that come from supporting modern storage media with old protocols.
