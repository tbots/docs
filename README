 Create a script that on ls -> lsi will list contents of the docker images directory and translate them to their
 respective names on the fly :).

 Create a script that will tag tasks with their names, sed(1).

 Maybe even better syntax highlighting for the sed(1)...

 Good question, is it possible to create a new session from existent tmux window?



 Improvements:

  - Ansible:
      
      + Add software: tmux, members
      + Improve authorized_key module utilization


 Hack all the scripts!

 find name of the process owning socket (netstat)
 find name of the process owning socket (fuser)


 Questions:
	- delete everything except of [a-zA-Z0-9-], any character class available?
	- how to add ansible hosts file to the bash_completition?
