 The /etc/fstab file contains an information about the filesystems the system can mount. It is only read by the programs but not written. The order of records is 
 important because fsck(8), mount(8), and umount(8) sequentaly iterate through fstab.

 Examples:
 	mount -a			# mount all filesystems mentioned in fstab(5)
	mount -l -t xfs		# limit lab

 FILESYSTEM INDEPENDENT OPTIONS

 	remount
						Attempt to remount an already mounted file system. This is commonly used to change the mount flags for a filesystem, especially to make read-only filesystem writable. It
						doesn't change device or mount point.
 mount [-l|-h|-V]
 mount -t <type> <dev> <dest>
