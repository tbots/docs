 Partitioning divides disk drive into one or more logical disks. Each partition is treated as a separate disk with its own
 file system. Partition information is stored in a partition table. There are two types of partitions that can be created
 using fdisk(1):
 	
	- Primary partitions
	- Extended partitions


 The original partitioning scheme for PC hard disks allowed only four partitions, called primary partitions. To create more than
 four partitions, one of these four partitions can be divided into many smaller partitions, called logical or extended partitions.

 Examples:
 	sudo fdisk -l | grep '\Sdev\S[^0-9 ]\+ '			# display only disks
