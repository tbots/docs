 		Process Management

 The first process run is the init process responsible for booting all of the services. It is easily seen with "file /proc/1/exe".
 The first target called is the default target unit file (/lib/systemd/system/default.target). It can be overriden with `--unit'
 flag.
 
 Configuration is read from /etc/systemd/system.conf and /etc/systemd/system.conf.d directory when run as a system instance, from
 /etc/systemd/user.conf and /etc/systemd/user.conf.d when run a user instance. Unit files are located under /lib/systemd/system by
 default.

 To list all the understood configuraiton items run:
 	
	$ systemd --dump-configuration-items
