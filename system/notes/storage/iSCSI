 iSCSI (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface) is a protocol that allows iSCSI commmands to be transmitted over a network.  Like a Fibre Channel, iSCSI provides all o
 f the necessary components for the construction of a Storage Area Network. iSCSI is defined in RFC 7143. For iSCSI communication, the following components talk with each other:
		· iSCSI Initiator
		· iSCSI Target

 iSCSI Initiator

 	A client in an iSCSI storage network is called iSCSI initiator Node. The iSCSI initiator then connect to a server, the iSCSI target, and send iSCSI commands to the iSCSI target.
	The iSCSI commands are packaged in IP packets for this purpose. The following forms of iSCSI iniators are available:
		
	 · iSCSI hardware initiator: a PCI-X or PCIe card, which implements the iSCSI fuctionality. Such a card is also called an iSCSI HBA (host bus adapter). In the server's operating
	   system, such an iSCSI HBA appears to be a RAID controller or an FC HBA. With an iSCSI HBA booting a servers through iSCSI is possible. 

	 · iSCSI software initiator: an iSCSI initiator implemented by software. The computing operations of the iSCSI initiator are performed by the server's CPU in this soution and not
	 	 Standard network cards are used on the hardware side for communication with the iSCSI target.

 iSCSI Target
  
	A server in an iSCSI storage network is called the iSCSI Target Node or simply iSCSI Target. Such an iSCSI target can provide one or more so-called logical units or LUs. The following
	iSCSI targets are available:
		
		· as a hardware as iSCSI storage arrays
		· as a software as iSCSI target software for installation on a standard server
