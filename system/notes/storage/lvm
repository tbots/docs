 === LVM ===

 	LVM (Logical Volume Management) is a storage device management technology that gives users the power to pool and abstract the physical layout of component storage devices for 
 	easier and flexible administration. Utilizing the device mapper Linux Kernel framework, the current iteration, LVM2, can be used to gather existing storage devices into groups and allocate 
	logical units from the combined space as needed. That will allow logical volumes to have meaningful names, volumes can be resized dynamically as space requirements changes and migrated 
	between physical devices with the pool on a running system or exported early. It also offers advanced feauters such as snapshotting, stripping and mirroring.
	
	LVM functions by layering abstractions on top of physical storage devices. The basic layers that LVM uses. starting with the most primitive:

		 · Physical Volumes (pv)
		 					Physical block devices or other disk-like devices (i.e., other devices created by device mapper, like RAID arrays) are used by LVM as the raw building material for higher levels of 
							abstraction. Physical volumes are regular storage devices. LVM writes a header to the device to allocate it for management.

		 · Volume Groups (vg)
							LVM combines physical volumes into storage pools known as volume groups. Volume groups abstract the characteristics of the underlying devices and function as a unified logical
							device with combined storage capacity of the component physical volumes.

		 · Logical Volumes (lv or lvm)
							A volume group can be sliced up into any number of logical volumes. Logical Volumes are functionally equivalent to partitions on a physical disk, but with much more flexibility
							Logical volume are the primary component that users and applications will interact with.
