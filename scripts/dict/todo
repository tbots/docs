 Future improvements:

 	Display random words according to starting letter by learning the words before.
	Maybe one day pack your solution for GETOPTS to be an argument string, so all the parsing is internal by including a library.
	Write script to re-align a dictionary file.
	Print word translation instead of error when trying to store duplicate word.
	Accept -d/--delete to delete an entry or -r/--rewrite to rewrite it on place.

 Ideas:
 	
	Display all the sourced files in a list.
