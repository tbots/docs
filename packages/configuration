 apt.conf is the main configuration file for the APT suite of tools, all tools make use of the configuration file and a common
 command-line parser to provide a uniform environment. When an APT tool strarts up it will read the configuration specified by
 the APT_CONFIG environment variable (if any) and the files in Dir::Etc::Parts then read the main configuration file specified 
 by Dir::Etc::main and then finally apply the command-line options to override the configuration directives, possible loading
 even more config files.

 The configuration file is organized in a tree with options organized into functional groups. Option specification is given with a
 colon notation, for instance APT:Get:Assume-Yes is an option within the APT tool group, for the Get tool. Options do not inherit from
 their parent groups. The configuration language is modeled after what the ISC tools such as bind and dhcp use. Lines starting with '//'
 are comments. Each line is of the form: 
 APT::Get::Assume-Yes "true"; 		// single configuration option; the traling semicolon is required and the quotes are optional
 APT { Get { Assume-Yes "true"; Fix-Broken "true"; }; }; // will open a new functional group
 RPM::Allow-Duplicates { "kernel"; "kernel-smp" };	// allows to include multiple entries

 Two special directives are allowed: 
 	#include   will include the given file, unless the filename ends in a slash, then the whole directory is included 
	#clear		 used to erase a list of names

 All of the APT tools take -o option which allows an arbitrary configuration to be specified on the command line. The syntax is a 
 full option name (APT::Get::Assume-Yes for instance) followed by an equals sign (=) then the new value of the option. Lists can
 be appended too by adding a trailing :: to the list name.

 
 Example files:
	/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/apt.conf
	/usr/share/doc/apt/examples/configure-index.gz			# list all apt configuration directives

 
 The APT Group 

 This group of options controls general APT behavior as well as holding the options for all of the tools.

 apt list --installed package_name
 								list installed packages

 apt list --upgradable package_name
 								list packages that can be upgraded to

 apt list --all-versions package_name
								list all package versions available

 * apt list command expects the exact package name to be specified


 apt search package_name
								list packages matched pattern in their description

 apt show package_name
								show information for the given package

 apt install package_name[/[release_name|release_class]]|==version]
 								install package; optional package pool can be specified by release code name/alias or release class

 the package choosen for the install and show operations is the newest one 
 if - appended to the end of package name it will be removed


 apt remove package_name[[/release_name|release_clas]]|=version]
 if + appended to the package name it will be installed

 apt-get clean
 									clean the local repository of retrieved package files
