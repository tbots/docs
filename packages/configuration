 apt.conf is the main configuration file for the APT suite of tools, all tools make use of the configuration file and a common
 command-line parser to provide a uniform environment. When an APT tool strarts up it will read the configuration specified by
 the APT_CONFIG environment variable (if any) and the files in Dir::Etc::Parts then read the main configuration file specified 
 by Dir::Etc::main and then finally apply the command-line options to override the configuration directives, possible loading
 even more config files.

 The configuration file is devided into a functional groups, see /usr/share/doc/apt/examples/apt.conf for an example.

 Two special directives are allowed: 
 	#include   will include the given file, unless the filename ends in a slash, then the whole directory is included 
	#clear		 used to erase a list of names


 All of the APT tools take -o option which allows an arbitrary configuration to be specified on the command line. The syntax is a 
 full option name (APT::Get::Assume-Yes for instance) followed by an equals sign (=) then the new value of the option. Lists can
 be appended too by adding a trailing :: to the list name.
